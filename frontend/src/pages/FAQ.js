                At Paprback, we prioritize the safety and well-being of all
                participants, especially when it comes to meeting strangers. We
                have established several safety guidelines to ensure a secure
                environment. These guidelines include recommending participants
                to meet in well-lit public spaces, preferably during daylight
                hours, and suggesting bringing a friend along for added
                security. We also encourage participants to exchange contact
                information beforehand and to notify a trusted person about the
                meetup details. It's important to trust your instincts and
                choose a neutral location for the swap. We advocate for open
                communication and respectful behaviour among participants. By
                following these safety guidelines, we strive to create a
                positive and secure environment for book lovers to connect, swap
                books, and foster a sense of community.

              If you're planning to be away or temporarily unable to participate in book swapping, our platform offers a convenient 'holiday mode' feature. 
              By activating holiday mode, your account will be temporarily set to an inactive status, preventing other users from attempting to interact with you during this period.
               This helps maintain a smooth and efficient experience for active users while respecting the availability and preferences of others. Once you're ready to resume book swapping, simply deactivate holiday mode to make your account active again. 
               This feature ensures that your book exchanging experience remains flexible and tailored to your needsâ€¨

              When posting a book for swap on our platform, it's important to specify your preferred method of exchange. You can indicate whether you're open to swapping the book in person, willing to post it, or open to both options. 
              However, please note that our posting service is restricted to the United Kingdom only. We kindly request users to ensure the accuracy of their mailing addresses and to package the books securely for shipping. 
              It's important to understand that our company cannot be held liable for any missing, damaged, or undelivered books during the shipping process. We encourage participants to communicate openly about their expectations and to choose a reliable postal service for book exchanges.
               By acknowledging these considerations, we aim to facilitate smooth and successful book swaps while prioritising user responsibility and understanding
