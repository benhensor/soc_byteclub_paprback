              At Paprback, we prioritize the safety and well-being of
              all participants, especially when it comes to meeting
              strangers. We have established several safety guidelines
              to ensure a secure environment. These guidelines include
              recommending participants to meet in well-lit public
              spaces, preferably during daylight hours, and suggesting
              bringing a friend along for added security. We also
              encourage participants to exchange contact information
              beforehand and to notify a trusted person about the
              meetup details. It's important to trust your instincts
              and choose a neutral location for the swap. We advocate
              for open communication and respectful behaviour among
              participants. By following these safety guidelines, we
              strive to create a positive and secure environment for
              book lovers to connect, swap books, and foster a sense
              of community.
